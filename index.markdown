The [AeneasVerif](https://github.com/AeneasVerif) organization is an umbrella
for several Rust verification projects. Its flagship project is
[Aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas) (pronunced [Ay-nay-as]), a
toolchain to translate safe Rust programs to functional models in a variety of
proof assistants, including [F\*](https://www.fstar-lang.org),
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/), [HOL4](https://hol-theorem-prover.org/) and
[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/).
