[Aeneas](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas) (pronunced [Ay-nay-as]) is a verification toolchain for Rust programs.  It relies on a translation from Rusts's MIR
internal language to a pure lamdba calculus.  It is intended to be used in combination with
[Charon](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/charon), which compiles Rust programs to an intermediate
representation called LLBC. It currently has backends for [F\*](https://www.fstar-lang.org),
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/), [HOL4](https://hol-theorem-prover.org/) and [LEAN](https://leanprover.github.io/).
